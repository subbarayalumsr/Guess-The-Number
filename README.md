# Guess-The-Number
Guess the Number is a simple Python command-line game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The player has 5 chances to guess the correct number. After each guess, the program provides hints such as "Too low!" or "Too high!". The game ends when the number is guessed correctly or when all chances are used.
